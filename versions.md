## Welcome to EpicTopia!

We help users record and share their long-term journeys or goals, which we call "epics".
EpicTopia helps you keep a record of your precious memories, connect with people who shared similar experiences, and find solutions that matter to you.


## Create your epics

What is epic? Epic is your long-term journeys, stories, or goals.
You can create your epics with specific categories, start dates, and end dates.
You can create multiple epics and manage them on the `Epics` board in the collection section.



## Add content to your epics


A post can contain
- Title (optional text)
- Description (optional text, up to 2500 characters)

You can also add milestones to record your significant progress. In your timeline, the posts and milestones are ordered in time sequence.

## Epic Settings

You can set the following properties for a given epic:

- Epic name
- Epic category

- End date

## You can update the epic status:

- In progress (default)
- Accomplished
- Discontinued for other reasons

## Activities Board

You can check how active you are in the past half-year on our activities board.
We display your daily activity level on each grid. The darker the color of the grid, the more active you were on that particular day.
