## Welcome to EpicTopia!

We help users record and share their long-term journeys or goals, which we call "epics".
EpicTopia helps you keep a record of your precious memories, connect with people who shared similar experiences, and find solutions that matter to you.


## Create your epics

What is epic? Epic is your long-term journeys, stories, or goals.
You can create your epics with specific categories, start dates, and end dates.
You can create multiple epics and manage them on the `Epics` board in the collection section.



## Add content to your epics


A post can contain
- Title (optional text)
- Description (optional text, up to 2500 characters)
- Up to 3 images

You can also add milestones to record your significant progress. In your timeline, the posts and milestones are ordered in time sequence.

## Epic Settings

You can set the following properties for a given epic:

- Epic name
- Epic category
- Start date
- End date

## You can update the epic status:

- In progress (default)
- Accomplished
- Discontinued for other reasons

## Activities Board

You can check how active you are in the past half-year on our activities board.
We display your daily activity level on each grid. The darker the color of the grid, the more active you were on that particular day.
We calculate your streak if you are consecutively active on multiple days.

## Social Section

You can interact with other users:
- Search other users and epics
- Explore other users' posts
- Subscribe to other users' epics and receive updates in the Subscription section
